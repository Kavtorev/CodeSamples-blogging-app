## Project Idea

Programming is a practical craft. Learning language we usually focus on understanding how functions, operators, loops, string formatting etc operate. Then we make a first attempt to apply gained knowledge in practice, possibly forgetting what we have learned so far and losing a thread of how to combine the work of all tools, putting away effective and elegant solutions. But, why not save some time and diversify the process, by focusing on what programming requires - on practice.

Many experienced programmers find a hobby to help beginner by solving problems that they faced with, for instance on the well-known platform Stack OverFlow, but what most of the problems are caused precisely because of a lack of understanding of how to apply the theory on practice, why not prevent the appearance  of "tedious bugs"  by showing how to do it right. Programmers with real-life experience could share "good programming practices", tips and tricks, real-life examples and their opinions, letting newbies, except of understanding of principals, have a clue why they are doing this.
